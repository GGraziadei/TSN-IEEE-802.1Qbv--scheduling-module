Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) covers the need for real-time applications, focusing on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), of a low latency deterministic synchronous affordable network.   
IEEE802.1Qbv working group defines a guideline to develop a Time Aware Shaper (TAS) to guarantee Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) of different time-critical requests to the network.
Starting from literature, in which the TSN class of traffic is limited to a homogeneous local network, this work aims to develop a TAS scheduler to support heterogeneous networks with interfaces with varying characteristics, such as throughput and propagation delay. 
This thesis treats TAS scheduling as an optimization problem. It produces two conceptual models, respectively an ILP model and a heuristic one to maximize the number of accepted requests and the determinism of the network and minimize the latency. The goal is achieved by estimating the jitter and delay of each time-critical transmission.
To support the specification of a heterogeneous network this work implements transformation functions to solve the space and time division problems and a transmission pipeline pattern to mitigate the effect of high propagation delay of a transportation network.
Conceptual models are validated with a simulation of a hypothetical scenario where a request traverses both WiFi interfaces and a transport network.
